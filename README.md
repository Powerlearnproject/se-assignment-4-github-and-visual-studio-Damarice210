Introduction to GitHub:
What is GitHub, and what are its primary functions and features? Explain how it supports collaborative software development.
What is GitHub
-   GitHub is a popular cloud-based platform that serves as a central repository for software development projects. It provides a collaborative environment for developers to share code, 
    track changes, and work together on projects of all sizes. Think of it as a digital workspace where developers can store, manage, and collaborate on their code.

What are its primary functions and features?
      Version Control: GitHub uses Git, a distributed version control system, to track changes to files over time. This allows developers to:
      Revert to previous versions: If a mistake is made, developers can easily revert to a working version.
      Collaborate effectively: Multiple developers can work on the same project simultaneously without overwriting each other's changes.
      Track changes: GitHub provides a clear history of changes, making it easy to see who made what modifications and when.
      Repositories: A repository, often referred to as a "repo," is a container for a project's files and history. Each repository can be public or private, allowing developers to 
      control access to their code.
      Pull Requests: Pull requests are a mechanism for proposing changes to a repository. Developers can create pull requests to suggest new features, bug fixes, or other changes. Other 
      developers can review the changes, provide feedback, and ultimately merge them into the main branch.
      Issues: Issues are a way to track tasks, bugs, and feature requests within a repository. Developers can assign issues to team members, set priorities, and discuss potential 
      solutions.
      Projects: GitHub provides a project management tool that allows developers to organize tasks, set deadlines, and track progress.
      Code Review: GitHub facilitates code review, a process where developers inspect each other's code to identify potential issues and improve quality.
      Integration with Other Tools: GitHub integrates with a wide range of development tools, including continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines, issue tracking
      systems, and project management software.

Explain how it supports collaborative software development.
      Work together efficiently: Developers can collaborate on projects from anywhere in the world.
      Maintain code quality: Code reviews and issue tracking help ensure high-quality code.
      Manage projects effectively: GitHub's project management tools help teams stay organized and on track.

What are branches in GitHub
Branches in GitHub are parallel versions of a repository. They allow developers to work on different features, bug fixes, or experimental changes without affecting the main branch, known as the "master" or "main" branch. This isolation helps to prevent conflicts and ensures that the main branch remains stable.

Describe the process of creating a branch, making changes, and merging it back into the main branch.
Create a new branch: Use the git branch <branch-name> command in your terminal or the GitHub interface to create a new branch.
Switch to the new branch: Use the git checkout <branch-name> command to switch to the newly created branch.
Make changes: Make your desired changes to the files in the branch.
Commit changes: Use the git commit -m "<commit message>" command to commit your changes.
Push changes to the remote repository: Use the git push origin <branch-name> command to push your changes to the remote GitHub repository.
Create a pull request: On GitHub, create a pull request from your branch to the main branch. This initiates a review process.
Review and merge: Other developers can review your changes and provide feedback. Once the changes are approved, they can be merged into the main branch using the "Merge" button in the pull request.
